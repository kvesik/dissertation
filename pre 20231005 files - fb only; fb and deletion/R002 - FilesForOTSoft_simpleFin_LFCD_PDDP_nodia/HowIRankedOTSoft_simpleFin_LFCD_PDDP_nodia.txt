******Now doing Stratum #2******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  *F3 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[oo] for /OO/.
  *F5 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[oo] for /OO/.

  *_B5F5 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[Oe] for /oe/.
  *_B5...F5 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[Oe] for /oe/.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is shown to be active by ruling out *[oo] for /OO/.
  Id(Bk) is shown to be active by ruling out *[oo] for /OO/.
  All unranked Faithfulness constraints are active.

Favor Specificity:
  Id(Bk) is excluded from stratum because Id(Bk)Syl1 is more specific.

Favor Autonomy:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is assigned 1 helper, based on /OO/ -/-> *[oo].  The helper is:
    *B5

  Lowest number of helpers:   1 
  Constraint Id(Bk)Syl1 joins the current stratum, having 1 helpers.
