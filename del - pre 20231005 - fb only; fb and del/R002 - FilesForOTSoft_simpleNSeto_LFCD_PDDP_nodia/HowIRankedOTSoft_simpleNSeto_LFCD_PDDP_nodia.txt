  *B1 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[ii] for /Ii/.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is shown to be active by ruling out *[oo] for /OO/.
  Id(Bk) is shown to be active by ruling out *[oo] for /OO/.
  All unranked Faithfulness constraints are active.

Favor Specificity:
  Id(Bk) is excluded from stratum because Id(Bk)Syl1 is more specific.

Favor Autonomy:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is assigned 1 helper, based on /OO/ -/-> *[oo].  The helper is:
    *B5

  Lowest number of helpers:   1 
  Constraint Id(Bk)Syl1 joins the current stratum, having 1 helpers.
