  Id(Bk) is excluded from stratum because it is inactive.
  MaxIOSyl1 is excluded from stratum because it is inactive.
  MaxIO is excluded from stratum because it is inactive.

Favor Specificity:
  (no cases found)

Favor Autonomy:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is assigned 2 helpers, based on /OA/ -/-> *[oa].  The helpers are:
    *B3
    *B5
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is assigned 1 helper, based on /AA/ -/-> *[aa].  The helper is:
    *B5

  Lowest number of helpers:   1 
  Constraint Id(Bk)Syl1 joins the current stratum, having 1 helpers.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Only remaining rankable constraints are inactive Faithfulness constraints.  
  All of them join the current stratum:

Ranking has failed.  This constraint set is unable to derive only winners.
