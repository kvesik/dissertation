******Now doing Stratum #1******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  *B1 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[ii] for /Ii/.

Favor Markedness:
  *F4_B5 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *F4..._B5 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B5F4 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B5...F4 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  Faithfulness constraints are excluded from stratum.

Results so far:

  Stratum 1 (newly ranked):    *F4_B5
                               *F4..._B5
                               *_B5F4
                               *_B5...F4

  Markedness constraints still unranked:
    *B1
  Faithfulness constraints still unranked:
    Id(Bk)Syl1
    Id(Bk)

******Now doing Stratum #2******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  *B1 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[ii] for /Ii/.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is shown to be active by ruling out *[ii] for /Ii/.
  Id(Bk) is shown to be active by ruling out *[ii] for /Ii/.
  All unranked Faithfulness constraints are active.

Favor Specificity:
  Id(Bk) is excluded from stratum because Id(Bk)Syl1 is more specific.

Favor Autonomy:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is assigned 0 helpers, based on /Ii/ -/-> *[ii].

  Lowest number of helpers:   0 
  Constraint Id(Bk)Syl1 joins the current stratum, having 0 helpers.

******Now doing Stratum #3******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  Search found no unranked constraints that prefer losers.

Favor Markedness:
  *B1 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  Faithfulness constraints are excluded from stratum.

Results so far:

  Stratum 1 (already ranked):  *F4_B5
                               *F4..._B5

  Markedness constraints still unranked:
    (none)
  Faithfulness constraints still unranked:

******Now doing Stratum #4******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  Search found no unranked constraints that prefer losers.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Only remaining rankable constraints are inactive Faithfulness constraints.  
  All of them join the current stratum:
    Id(Bk)

Results so far:

  Stratum 1 (already ranked):  *F4_B5
                               *F4..._B5

  Stratum 2 (already ranked):  Id(Bk)Syl1
  Stratum 3 (already ranked):  *B1
  Stratum 4 (newly ranked):    Id(Bk)

  Markedness constraints still unranked:
    (none)
  Faithfulness constraints still unranked:
    (none)

Ranking is complete and yields successful grammar.
