******Now doing Stratum #1******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  *F1 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[oA] for /OA/.
  *F4_B5 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[OO] for /Oo/.
  *F4..._B5 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[OO] for /Oo/.
  *B1 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[ii] for /Ii/.
  *F3..._B2 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[Ooe] for /OoE/.

Favor Markedness:
  *F3_B2 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B5F4 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B5...F4 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  Faithfulness constraints are excluded from stratum.

Results so far:

  Stratum 1 (newly ranked):    *F3_B2
                               *_B5F4
                               *_B5...F4

******Now doing Stratum #2******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  *F1 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[oa] for /OA/.
  *F4_B5 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[OO] for /Oo/.
  *F4..._B5 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[OO] for /Oo/.
  *B1 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[ii] for /Ii/.
  *F3..._B2 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[OOe] for /OoE/.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is shown to be active by ruling out *[oa] for /OA/.
  Id(Bk) is shown to be active by ruling out *[oa] for /OA/.
  All unranked Faithfulness constraints are active.

Favor Specificity:
  Id(Bk) is excluded from stratum because Id(Bk)Syl1 is more specific.

Favor Autonomy:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is assigned 0 helpers, based on /OA/ -/-> *[oa].

  Lowest number of helpers:   0 
  Constraint Id(Bk)Syl1 joins the current stratum, having 0 helpers.

******Now doing Stratum #5******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  Search found no unranked constraints that prefer losers.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:

  All of them join the current stratum:
    Id(Bk)
