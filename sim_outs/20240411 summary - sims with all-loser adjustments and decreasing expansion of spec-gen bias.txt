ran sims with no gravity or helium --> unsurprisingly, triggered no specgenbias expansions

tried again with helium (preferspecificity)...
 - expansion (whether decreasing inversely with number of errors or number of trials, and whether starting at 0 or 20) still goes up quite high. sample output below.

... ok but is that actually my challenge at the moment? i think not. :(


starting at specgenbias = 20, decreasing expansion inversely with number of learning trials
