******Now doing Stratum #1******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  Search found no unranked constraints that prefer losers.

Favor Markedness:
  *B2 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *F3_B5 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *F3..._B5 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B5F3 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B5...F3 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  Faithfulness constraints are excluded from stratum.

Results so far:

  Stratum 1 (newly ranked):    *B2
                               *F3_B5
                               *F3..._B5
                               *_B5F3
                               *_B5...F3

  Markedness constraints still unranked:
    (none)
  Faithfulness constraints still unranked:
    Id(Bk)Syl1
    Id(Bk)

******Now doing Stratum #2******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  Search found no unranked constraints that prefer losers.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Only remaining rankable constraints are inactive Faithfulness constraints.  
  All of them join the current stratum:
    Id(Bk)Syl1
    Id(Bk)

Results so far:

  Stratum 1 (already ranked):  *B2
                               *F3_B5
                               *F3..._B5
                               *_B5F3
                               *_B5...F3
  Stratum 2 (newly ranked):    Id(Bk)Syl1
                               Id(Bk)

  Markedness constraints still unranked:
    (none)
  Faithfulness constraints still unranked:
    (none)

Ranking is complete and yields successful grammar.
