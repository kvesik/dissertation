******Now doing Stratum #1******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  *F3 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[oe] for /Oe/.
  *B2 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[ee] for /Ee/.

Favor Markedness:
  *B1 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *F3_B1 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *F3..._B1 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *F3_B2 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *F3..._B2 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B1F3 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B1...F3 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B2F3 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  *_B2...F3 is a Markedness constraint that favors no losers, joins new stratum.
  Faithfulness constraints are excluded from stratum.

Results so far:

  Stratum 1 (newly ranked):    *B1
                               *F3_B1

******Now doing Stratum #2******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  *F3 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[oe] for /Oe/.
  *B2 is excluded from stratum; prefers loser *[ee] for /Ee/.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is shown to be active by ruling out *[oe] for /Oe/.
  Id(Bk) is shown to be active by ruling out *[oe] for /Oe/.
  All unranked Faithfulness constraints are active.

Favor Specificity:
  Id(Bk) is excluded from stratum because Id(Bk)Syl1 is more specific.

Favor Autonomy:
  Id(Bk)Syl1 is assigned 0 helpers, based on /Oe/ -/-> *[oe].

  Lowest number of helpers:   0 
  Constraint Id(Bk)Syl1 joins the current stratum, having 0 helpers.

******Now doing Stratum #4******

Avoid Preference For Losers:
  Search found no unranked constraints that prefer losers.

Favor Markedness:
  There are no rankable Markedness constraints.

Favor Activeness:
  Only remaining rankable constraints are inactive Faithfulness constraints.  
  All of them join the current stratum:
    Id(Bk)
